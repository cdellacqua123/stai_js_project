    <h3>What is Technical Analysis? What is this website?</h3>
    <p>Technical Analysis is the financial methodology of using statistical data 
        of financial instruments in order to make predictions about the market. 
        The used instruments can be anything that is traded in the open market, 
        including equities, derivatives, and fixed income. The data that is pulled 
        & used for the analysis can be a variety of information from the instrument, 
        from closing prices, highs/lows of certain time periods, volume of trading, 
        etc. When this information is applied to a formula, the result is what is 
        known as an “indicator”. This website was designed to provide multiple of 
        these indicators in order to help people analyze stock prices to better 
        help their trading. If you would like to learn more about technical analysis,
